# monkeyfortune

This program does basically the same thing you expect `fortune` to do, except with monkeytype.com quotes instead of whatever quotes `fortune` uses.
Pipe into `cowsay` as desired. 

Currently, if you would like to use this tool, the only way to do so is to clone the repository into the location of your choosing

## what each file does (idk how to document)
`monkeyfortune.c` - the source code in questoin

`update-quote-repo.sh` - bash script that updates all the quote repositories
