# monkeyfortune

This program does basically the same thing you expect `fortune` to do, except with monkeytype.com quotes instead of whatever quotes `fortune` uses.
Pipe into `cowsay` as desired. 

As of right now, this is still a work in progress, not very much ready for anything.

## what each file does (idk how to document)
`monkeyfortune.c` - the source code in questoin

`update-quote-repo.sh` - bash script that updates all the quote repositories 

`fortune.c` - doesn't do anything. this is the original source code for `fortune` but i aint reading allat
