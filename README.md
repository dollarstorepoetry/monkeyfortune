# monkeyfortune

This program does basically the same thing you expect `fortune` to do, except with monkeytype.com quotes instead of whatever quotes `fortune` uses.
Pipe into `cowsay` as desired. 

To use this, clone this repository wherever you'd like, then run `cd monkeyfortune/src && make`. Now can run monkeyfortune :)

## what each file does (idk how to document)
`monkeyfortune.c` - main source code

`update-quote-repo.sh` - bash script that updates all the quote repositories
