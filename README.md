# monkeyfortune

This program does basically the same thing you expect `fortune` to do, except with monkeytype.com quotes instead of whatever quotes `fortune` uses.
Pipe into `cowsay` as desired. 

To use this, clone this repository, then run `cd monkeyfortune/src && make`. You may have to install `cjson` through whatever package manager is applicable to you
